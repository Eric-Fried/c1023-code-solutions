## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?

a function is a block of code that be passed certain data and then can do whatever you wish with that data and even return a result of what it does

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

declarative functinon keyword, optional name, comma separted list of parameters, code block , optional return statement

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.

function name, comma separated list of arguments

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

defining a function does just that and defines it for later use, but calling a function is actually asking javascript to execute that code

calling has the () after the function name and doesnt have a keyword before it

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

a parameter is a placeholder for arguments that will be passed when the function is actually called

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  parameters allow for you to make a function that is very minimal and clean but can be passed large elements such as objects or arrays to then use and not have to store within their local memory.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  return statement ends the execution of the block of code and also returns whatever follows the return keyword to global memory instead of allowing it to be garbage collected and not be usable for future operations
